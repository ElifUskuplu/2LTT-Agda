# 2LTT-Agda-without-cumulativity

Actually, this version of the library has exactly the same content as the initial version. 
The most fundamental difference is that in this version, the `--cumulativity` flag is not assumed. 
That is, we are not using the assumption in the UP paper that 'every type is an exo-type'. 
Instead, we use a coercion map as in the 2LTT paper. We also have term conversion rules.

```agda
record C {i : Level} (A : UU i) : UUáµ‰ i where
  constructor c
  field
    ic : A
```

---
This folder has been organized in a similar manner to the other 2LTT folder.

Thanks for being the inspiration for this arrangement, [Josh Chen](https://joshchen.io/).
